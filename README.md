# Active-Directory-Lab-In-VirtualBox

## Objective
The goal of this lab is to build, configure and exploit an Active Directory environment to simulate an attack scenario in an enterprise network. The lab consists of a pfSense firewall/router to manage the internal network, a Windows Server domain controller, two Windows 10 client machines, a Kali Linux machine as the attacking platform and a Wazuh SIEM machine with Suricata for real-time defensive monitoring. The lab provides a controlled environment for exploring common vulnerabilities, defensive methods and attacks within a Windows domain network.
